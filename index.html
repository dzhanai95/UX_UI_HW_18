            <p>I am a freelance designer and UX/UI design student based in Georgia. My goal is to take ideas and form them into designs that are useful for all.

            My academic background is in linguistics, but my first choice was originally Graphic Design. I have always enjoyed bringing ideas to life through art and design.
            
            I stumbled upon UX/UI Design while working in Telesales for a telecommunications company. After the different conversations I had with customers, I began to be disheartened by the fact that I was trained how to solve problems for customers, but a lot of the information was not seeable to them. As a freelance designer, I began to wonder if there was a reason behind why the apps and website were designed the way they were. It was through this curiosity that I began researching UX/UI design. The more I researched it, the more I became interested in the field. I really liked that UX design not only focused on business goals, but holds empathy for the users as its top priority.
